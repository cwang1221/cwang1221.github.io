# About Me
I've been working in SAP as a **Frontend Developer** for 5 years. Besides daily development, I also work in the role of **Frontend Architect** for our product - S/4HANA Subscription Billing. This allows me to influence high-level topics like UI strategy, UI integration, UI test automation improvement, etc. I'm also the **UX Advocate** in my team to guide my colleagues on UX-related topics.

## Some Other Things
In a team of 25 people, I was nominated as
- SAP Catalyst (2 nominations in my team)
- SAP Mini-Expert (3 nominations in my team)
- SAP Thought Leader (only one in my team)

These can serve as proof of my hard/soft skills.

## Available Working Hours
For remote jobs, my working hours could be any 8 hours between 17 pm - 11 am EST.
