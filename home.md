# About Me
I've been working in SAP as a **Frontend Developer** for 5 years. Besides daily development, I also work in the role of **Frontend Architect** for our product - S/4HANA Subscription Billing. This allows me to influence high-level topics like UI strategy, UI integration, UI test automation improvement, and etc. I'm also the **UX Advocate** in my team to guide my colleagues on UX related topics.

**To prove my capability, I registered a Clubhouse trial account and implemented a similar project [Raji](https://cwang1221.github.io/docs/raji/raji.html). Please give it a try!**

## Some Other Things about Me
In a team of 25 people, I was nominated as
- SAP Catalyst (2 nominations in my team)
- SAP Mini-Expert (3 nominations in my team)
- SAP Thought Leader (only one in my team)

These can serve as proof of my hard/soft skills.

## About My City
I live in Chengdu, China. Besides pandas and foods, Chengdu is also famous for its vast software talent pool. This attracts many global software companies to open their offices here, such as SAP, Microsoft, Intel, Amazon and Sony. I believe Clubhouse may consider extending the business to China, the second largest economy in the world. Hiring me could be an excellent starting point.
