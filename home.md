# About Me
I've worked in SAP as a **Frontend Developer** for 5 years. Besides daily development I also take the role of **Frontend Architect** for the whole product. Which requests me to take high-level topics like UI strategy, UI integration, UI test automation improvement and so on. I'm also the **UX Advocate** in my team, to guide my colleagues on UX related topics.

**To prove my ability, I applied a Clubhouse trial account and implemented a similar project [Raji](https://cwang1221.github.io/docs/raji/raji.html). Please give it a try!**

## My Characters

### Strong Coding Ability
The main task of a developer is product delivery, which I'm really good at. Normally I could finished my tasks with **only 2/3 estimated efforts**. As a perfectionist I'm really strict to my code. I could complete the tasks quickly with high quality.

### Problem Solving Ability
I'm good at bugs locating and problems solving. When there's a critical UI issue, I'm always the most trustable one to solve it.

### Strong Study Ability
I can achieve new skills in short time. Here's an example, in SAP I seldomly use React. I started learning React in my spare time from May and completed the [Raji](https://cwang1221.github.io/docs/raji/raji.html) project within **120 hours**.

### Teamwork
I believe teamwork is great. Discussion could always bring value
to the product. I like helping colleagues to solve problems and sharing my knowledge to help the team grow.

### Some Achievements
In a team of 25 people, I was nominated as
- SAP Catalyst (2 nominations in my team)
- SAP Mini-Experts (3 nominations in my team)
- SAP Thought Leader (only one in my team)

These are also provements of my hard / soft skills.

### About My City
I'm located in Chengdu. Besides pandas and foods, Chengdu is also famous for the huge software telent pool. Which is attracting many global software companies to open their office here, like SAP, Microsoft, Intel, Amazon, Sony and so on. I believe Clubhouse is also willing to extend the office and business to the second largest market - China. Then hiring me might be a really good starting point.
