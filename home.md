# About Me
I've been working in SAP as a **Frontend Developer** for 5 years. Besides daily development, I also take the role of **Frontend Architect** for the whole product. This requests me to take high-level topics like UI strategy, UI integration, UI test automation improvement and etc. I'm also the **UX Advocate** in my team to guide my colleagues on UX related topics.

**To prove my ability, I registered a Clubhouse trial account and implemented a similar project [Raji](https://cwang1221.github.io/docs/raji/raji.html). Please give it a try!**

## My Characters

### Strong Coding Capability
The main task of a developer is product delivery, which I'm really good at. Normally I could finished my tasks within **only 2/3 estimated efforts**. As a perfectionist, I'm really strict to my code. I could complete the tasks quickly with high quality.

### Problem Solving Capability
I'm good at troubleshooting and problem solving. Whenever there's a critical UI issue, I'm always the most trustable developer to solve it.

### Strong Learning Capability
I can achieve new skills in a short time. Here's an example, in SAP I seldomly use React. I started learning React in my spare time in May, 2021, and completed the [Raji](https://cwang1221.github.io/docs/raji/raji.html) project within **120 hours**.

### Teamwork
I believe in teamwork. Discussion could always bring value
to the product. I enjoy helping colleagues to solve technical issues and sharing my knowledge to help the team grow.

### Some Achievements
In a team of 25 people, I was nominated as
- SAP Catalyst (2 nominations in my team)
- SAP Mini-Experts (3 nominations in my team)
- SAP Thought Leader (only one in my team)

These can serve as proof of my hard / soft skills.

### About My City
I live in Chengdu, China. Besides pandas and foods, Chengdu is also famous for its vast software telent pool. This attracts many global software companies to open their offices here, such as SAP, Microsoft, Intel, Amazon and Sony. I believe Clubhouse may consider extending the business to China, the second largest economy in the world. Hiring me cout be an excellent starting point.
