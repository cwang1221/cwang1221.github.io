# Raji

Raji is a Jira-like PoC (proof of competency :)) project. Which is simulating the appearance and main functionalities of [Clubhouse](https://clubhouse.io/).

![Raji](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cwang1221/cwang1221.github.io/main/images/raji-stories.png)


Raji is built with:
- Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB
- Frontend: React + Antd

Source code is [here](https://github.com/cwang1221/raji-app)

## Try out Raji

Open Raji [here](http://39.103.224.134:3000/), Following are users to login, password is `Welcome1!`:
- `david.lewis@raji.com`
- `pamela.danni@raji.com`
- `margareta.stefanie@raji.com`
- `wen.li@raji.com`

Matters need attention:
- When open the website for the first time, it might be a bit slow since it has to download the resource files. Later it will be much smoother because of cache.
- Both service and UI are deployed in China, so please expecting a slower response.
- Please pay attention of the detailed behavior of the controls, which I tried to make it similar to Claubhouse. E.g. layout, filters, project color selectors.
