# Concepts

Similar to Clubhouse, there are 4 major concepts in Raji:
- Project
- Milestone
- Epic
- Story

## Project
Projects represent technical components (such as Backend and Frontend) or feature areas within the product. Different projects could belong to workflows. In Raji, there are two predefined workflows, **Web** and **Mobile**.

As a user, you could create/update projects in the two workflows. You could also specify the color of a project, which could be used to indicate which project a story belongs to.

## Milestone
Milestones are collections of Epics that can represent a large amount of work your organization wants to do over a longer period of time, such as a month or a quarter. A milestone could contain many epics.

## Story
The story is the most important concept in Raji. It could represent a task that needs to be done. Stories are the basic components of an epic. A story always has a project type.
