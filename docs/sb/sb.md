# Subscription Billing

Nowadays more and more companies are selling their products based on subscriptions, e.g. AT&T, App Store, Netflix. How to manage the lifecycle of a subscription? How to calculate the price? Such problems could be easily solved with Subscription Billing.

The main frontend technology used in Subscription Billing is [SAPUI5](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/), a component-based Javascript library.
