# About Me
I've worked in SAP as a **Frontend Developer** for 5 years. Besides daily development I also take the role of **Frontend Architect** for the whole product. Which requests me to take highlevel topics like UI strategy, UI integration, UI test automation improvement and so on. I'm also the **UX Advocate** in my team, to guide my colleagues on UX related topics.

**To prove my ability, I applied a Clubhouse trial account and implement a similar website [Raji](https://cwang1221.github.io/docs/raji/raji.html). Please give it a try!**

## My Characters

### Strong Coding Ability
The main task of a developer is product delivery, which I'm really good at. Normally I could finished my tasks with **only 2/3 estimated points**. As a perfectionist I'm very strict to my code. I could finish the tasks quickly with high quality.

### Problem Solving Ability
I'm good at bugs locating and problems solving. When there's a critical UI issue, I'm always the most trustable one to solve it.

### Strong Study Ability
I can achieve new skills in short time. Here's an example, in SAP I don't use much React. I started learning React in my spare time from May and finished the [Raji](https://cwang1221.github.io/docs/raji/raji.html) project in **120 hours**.

### Teamwork
I like teamwork. Discussion could always bring value
to the product. And I like help others to solve their problems and sharing my knowledge to help the team grow.

### Other Things
In a team of 26 people, I was nominated as
- SAP Catalyst in my team (2 nominations)
- SAP Mini-Experts (3 nominations)
- SAP Thought Leader (1 nomination)

These are also provements of my ability.

### About My City
I'm located in Chengdu. Besides pandas and foods, Chengdu is very famous for the large storage of software telents. Which is attracting many global companies to open their office here, like SAP, Accenture, Oracle and so on. I believe Clubhouse is also willing to extend the office and business to the second largest market, China. Then hiring me will be a very good starting point.
