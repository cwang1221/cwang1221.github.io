# Raji

Raji is a Jira-like PoC (proof of competency :)) project. Which is simulating the appearance and main functionalities of [Clubhouse](https://clubhouse.io/).

## Try out Raji

Open Raji [here](http://39.103.224.134:3000/), Following are users to login, the password is `Welcome1!`:
- `david.lewis@raji.com`
- `pamela.danni@raji.com`
- `margareta.stefanie@raji.com`
- `wen.li@raji.com`

Matters need attention:
- When opening the website for the first time, it might be a bit slow since it has to download the resource files. Later it will be much smoother because of cache.
- Both service and UI are deployed in China, so please expecting a slower response.
- Please pay attention to the detailed behavior of the controls, which I tried to make similar to Clubhouse. E.g. layout, filters, project color selectors.
